Article 5
Principles relating to processing of personal data

1. Personal data shall be:
   (a) processed lawfully, fairly and in a transparent manner in relation to the data subject (‘lawfulness, fairness and
       transparency’);
   (b) collected for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes and not further processed in a manner that is incompatible
       with those purposes; further processing for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research
       purposes or statistical purposes shall, in accordance with Article 89(1), not be considered to be incompatible with
       the initial purposes (‘purpose limitation’);
   (c) adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are processed (‘data
       minimisation’);
   (d) accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date; every reasonable step must be taken to ensure that personal data that
       are inaccurate, having regard to the purposes for which they are processed, are erased or rectified without delay
       (‘accuracy’); 
   (e) kept in a form which permits identification of data subjects for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for
       which the personal data are processed; personal data may be stored for longer periods insofar as the personal data
       will be processed solely for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or
       statistical purposes in accordance with Article 89(1) subject to implementation of the appropriate technical and
       organisational measures required by this Regulation in order to safeguard the rights and freedoms of the data subject
       (‘storage limitation’);
   (f) processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security of the personal data, including protection against
       unauthorised or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction or damage, using appropriate technical
       or organisational measures (‘integrity and confidentiality’).
2. The controller shall be responsible for, and be able to demonstrate compliance with, paragraph 1 (‘accountability’).

Article 6
Lawfulness of processing

1. Processing shall be lawful only if and to the extent that at least one of the following applies:
   (a) the data subject has given consent to the processing of his or her personal data for one or more specific purposes;
   (b) processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party or in order to take steps
       at the request of the data subject prior to entering into a contract;
   (c) processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the controller is subject;
   (d) processing is necessary in order to protect the vital interests of the data subject or of another natural person;
   (e) processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official
       authority vested in the controller;
   (f) processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party,
       except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject
       which require protection of personal data, in particular where the data subject is a child.
   Point (f) of the first subparagraph shall not apply to processing carried out by public authorities in the performance of
   their tasks.
2. Member States may maintain or introduce more specific provisions to adapt the application of the rules of this
   Regulation with regard to processing for compliance with points (c) and (e) of paragraph 1 by determining more
   precisely specific requirements for the processing and other measures to ensure lawful and fair processing including for
   other specific processing situations as provided for in Chapter IX.
3. The basis for the processing referred to in point (c) and (e) of paragraph 1 shall be laid down by:
   (a) Union law; or
   (b) Member State law to which the controller is subject.
   The purpose of the processing shall be determined in that legal basis or, as regards the processing referred to in point (e)
   of paragraph 1, shall be necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of
   official authority vested in the controller. That legal basis may contain specific provisions to adapt the application of
   rules of this Regulation, inter alia: the general conditions governing the lawfulness of processing by the controller; the
   types of data which are subject to the processing; the data subjects concerned; the entities to, and the purposes for
   which, the personal data may be disclosed; the purpose limitation; storage periods; and processing operations and
   processing procedures, including measures to ensure lawful and fair processing such as those for other specific
   processing situations as provided for in Chapter IX. The Union or the Member State law shall meet an objective of
   public interest and be proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued.
4. Where the processing for a purpose other than that for which the personal data have been collected is not based
   on the data subject's consent or on a Union or Member State law which constitutes a necessary and proportionate
   measure in a democratic society to safeguard the objectives referred to in Article 23(1), the controller shall, in order to
   ascertain whether processing for another purpose is compatible with the purpose for which the personal data are
   initially collected, take into account, inter alia:
   (a) any link between the purposes for which the personal data have been collected and the purposes of the intended
       further processing;
   (b) the context in which the personal data have been collected, in particular regarding the relationship between data
       subjects and the controller;
   (c) the nature of the personal data, in particular whether special categories of personal data are processed, pursuant to
       Article 9, or whether personal data related to criminal convictions and offences are processed, pursuant to Article
       10;
   (d) the possible consequences of the intended further processing for data subjects;
   (e) the existence of appropriate safeguards, which may include encryption or pseudonymisation.
",6,Lawfulness of processing,2,Principles,671,Under what circumstances is processing of personal data considered lawful?,"Processing of personal data is considered lawful if at least one of the following applies: (a) the data subject has given consent to the processing of his or her personal data for one or more specific purposes; (b) processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party or in order to take steps at the request of the data subject prior to entering into a contract; (c) processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the controller is subject; (d) processing is necessary in order to protect the vital interests of the data subject or of another natural person; (e) processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller; (f) processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party, except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require protection of personal data, in particular where the data subject is a child.",10,189
"
Article 7
Conditions for consent

1. Where processing is based on consent, the controller shall be able to demonstrate that the data subject has
   consented to processing of his or her personal data.
2. If the data subject's consent is given in the context of a written declaration which also concerns other matters, the
   request for consent shall be presented in a manner which is clearly distinguishable from the other matters, in an
   intelligible and easily accessible form, using clear and plain language. Any part of such a declaration which constitutes
   an infringement of this Regulation shall not be binding.
3. The data subject shall have the right to withdraw his or her consent at any time. The withdrawal of consent shall
   not affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal. Prior to giving consent, the data subject
   shall be informed thereof. It shall be as easy to withdraw as to give consent.
4. When assessing whether consent is freely given, utmost account shall be taken of whether, inter alia, the
   performance of a contract, including the provision of a service, is conditional on consent to the processing of personal
   data that is not necessary for the performance of that contract.

   holder of parental responsibility over the child, taking into consideration available technology.
3. Paragraph 1 shall not affect the general contract law of Member States such as the rules on the validity, formation
   or effect of a contract in relation to a child.

Article 5
Principles relating to processing of personal data

1. Personal data shall be:
   (a) processed lawfully, fairly and in a transparent manner in relation to the data subject (‘lawfulness, fairness and
       transparency’);
   (b) collected for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes and not further processed in a manner that is incompatible
       with those purposes; further processing for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research
       purposes or statistical purposes shall, in accordance with Article 89(1), not be considered to be incompatible with
       the initial purposes (‘purpose limitation’);
   (c) adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are processed (‘data
       minimisation’);
   (d) accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date; every reasonable step must be taken to ensure that personal data that
       are inaccurate, having regard to the purposes for which they are processed, are erased or rectified without delay
       (‘accuracy’); 
   (e) kept in a form which permits identification of data subjects for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for
       which the personal data are processed; personal data may be stored for longer periods insofar as the personal data
       will be processed solely for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or
       statistical purposes in accordance with Article 89(1) subject to implementation of the appropriate technical and
       organisational measures required by this Regulation in order to safeguard the rights and freedoms of the data subject
       (‘storage limitation’);
   (f) processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security of the personal data, including protection against
       unauthorised or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction or damage, using appropriate technical
       or organisational measures (‘integrity and confidentiality’).
2. The controller shall be responsible for, and be able to demonstrate compliance with, paragraph 1 (‘accountability’).
",5,Principles relating to processing of personal data,2,Principles,295,What does the principle of purpose limitation state?,"The principle of purpose limitation states that personal data should be collected for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes and not further processed in a manner that is incompatible with those purposes.",8,31
"
Article 6
Lawfulness of processing

1. Processing shall be lawful only if and to the extent that at least one of the following applies:
   (a) the data subject has given consent to the processing of his or her personal data for one or more specific purposes;
   (b) processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party or in order to take steps
       at the request of the data subject prior to entering into a contract;
   (c) processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the controller is subject;
   (d) processing is necessary in order to protect the vital interests of the data subject or of another natural person;
   (e) processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official
       authority vested in the controller;
   (f) processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party,
       except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject
       which require protection of personal data, in particular where the data subject is a child.
   Point (f) of the first subparagraph shall not apply to processing carried out by public authorities in the performance of
   their tasks.
2. Member States may maintain or introduce more specific provisions to adapt the application of the rules of this
   Regulation with regard to processing for compliance with points (c) and (e) of paragraph 1 by determining more
   precisely specific requirements for the processing and other measures to ensure lawful and fair processing including for
   other specific processing situations as provided for in Chapter IX.
3. The basis for the processing referred to in point (c) and (e) of paragraph 1 shall be laid down by:
   (a) Union law; or
   (b) Member State law to which the controller is subject.
   The purpose of the processing shall be determined in that legal basis or, as regards the processing referred to in point (e)
   of paragraph 1, shall be necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of
   official authority vested in the controller. That legal basis may contain specific provisions to adapt the application of
   rules of this Regulation, inter alia: the general conditions governing the lawfulness of processing by the controller; the
   types of data which are subject to the processing; the data subjects concerned; the entities to, and the purposes for
   which, the personal data may be disclosed; the purpose limitation; storage periods; and processing operations and
   processing procedures, including measures to ensure lawful and fair processing such as those for other specific
   processing situations as provided for in Chapter IX. The Union or the Member State law shall meet an objective of
   public interest and be proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued.
4. Where the processing for a purpose other than that for which the personal data have been collected is not based
   on the data subject's consent or on a Union or Member State law which constitutes a necessary and proportionate
   measure in a democratic society to safeguard the objectives referred to in Article 23(1), the controller shall, in order to
   ascertain whether processing for another purpose is compatible with the purpose for which the personal data are
   initially collected, take into account, inter alia:
   (a) any link between the purposes for which the personal data have been collected and the purposes of the intended
       further processing;
   (b) the context in which the personal data have been collected, in particular regarding the relationship between data
       subjects and the controller;
   (c) the nature of the personal data, in particular whether special categories of personal data are processed, pursuant to
       Article 9, or whether personal data related to criminal convictions and offences are processed, pursuant to Article
       10;
   (d) the possible consequences of the intended further processing for data subjects;
   (e) the existence of appropriate safeguards, which may include encryption or pseudonymisation.
",6,Lawfulness of processing,2,Principles,671,What is the purpose of point (f) of the first subparagraph of Article 6?,"The purpose of point (f) of the first subparagraph of Article 6 is to allow processing of personal data for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party, except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require protection of personal data, in particular where the data subject is a child.",14,68
"
Article 7
Conditions for consent

1. Where processing is based on consent, the controller shall be able to demonstrate that the data subject has
   consented to processing of his or her personal data.
2. If the data subject's consent is given in the context of a written declaration which also concerns other matters, the
   request for consent shall be presented in a manner which is clearly distinguishable from the other matters, in an
   intelligible and easily accessible form, using clear and plain language. Any part of such a declaration which constitutes
   an infringement of this Regulation shall not be binding.
3. The data subject shall have the right to withdraw his or her consent at any time. The withdrawal of consent shall
   not affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal. Prior to giving consent, the data subject
   shall be informed thereof. It shall be as easy to withdraw as to give consent.
4. When assessing whether consent is freely given, utmost account shall be taken of whether, inter alia, the
   performance of a contract, including the provision of a service, is conditional on consent to the processing of personal
   data that is not necessary for the performance of that contract.
",7,Conditions for consent,2,Principles,204,What is the requirement for obtaining consent in the context of a written declaration?,"If the data subject's consent is given in the context of a written declaration which also concerns other matters, the request for consent shall be presented in a manner which is clearly distinguishable from the other matters, in an intelligible and easily accessible form, using clear and plain language.",14,49

Article 8
Conditions applicable to child's consent in relation to information society services

1. Where point (a) of Article 6(1) applies, in relation to the offer of information society services directly to a child,
   the processing of the personal data of a child shall be lawful where the child is at least 16 years old. Where the child is
   below the age of 16 years, such processing shall be lawful only if and to the extent that consent is given or authorised
   by the holder of parental responsibility over the child.
   Member States may provide by law for a lower age for those purposes provided that such lower age is not below 13
   years.
2. The controller shall make reasonable efforts to verify in such cases that consent is given or authorised by the
   holder of parental responsibility over the child, taking into consideration available technology.
3. Paragraph 1 shall not affect the general contract law of Member States such as the rules on the validity, formation
   or effect of a contract in relation to a child. 
",8,Conditions applicable to child's consent in relation to information society services,2,Principles,177,What is the responsibility of the controller in verifying consent for processing personal data of a child?,"The controller shall make reasonable efforts to verify in such cases that consent is given or authorized by the holder of parental responsibility over the child, taking into consideration available technology.",17,31

Article 28
Processor
1. Where processing is to be carried out on behalf of a controller, the controller shall use only processors providing sufficient guarantees to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures in such a manner that processing will meet the requirements of this Regulation and ensure the protection of the rights of the data subject.
2. The processor shall not engage another processor without prior specific or general written authorisation of the controller. In the case of general written authorisation, the processor shall inform the controller of any intended changes concerning the addition or replacement of other processors, thereby giving the controller the opportunity to object to such changes.
3. Processing by a processor shall be governed by a contract or other legal act under Union or Member State law, that is binding on the processor with regard to the controller and that sets out the subject-matter and duration of the processing, the nature and purpose of the processing, the type of personal data and categories of data subjects and the obligations and rights of the controller. That contract or other legal act shall stipulate, in particular, that the processor:
(a) processes the personal data only on documented instructions from the controller, including with regard to transfers of personal data to a third country or an international organisation, unless required to do so by Union or Member State law to which the processor is subject; in such a case, the processor shall inform the controller of that legal requirement before processing, unless that law prohibits such information on important grounds of public interest;
(b) ensures that persons authorised to process the personal data have committed themselves to confidentiality or are under an appropriate statutory obligation of confidentiality;
(c) takes all measures required pursuant to Article 32;
(d) respects the conditions referred to in paragraphs 2 and 4 for engaging another processor;
(e) taking into account the nature of the processing, assists the controller by appropriate technical and organisational measures, insofar as this is possible, for the fulfilment of the controller's obligation to respond to requests for exercising the data subject's rights laid down in Chapter III;
(f) assists the controller in ensuring compliance with the obligations pursuant to Articles 32 to 36 taking into account the nature of processing and the information available to the processor;
(g) at the choice of the controller, deletes or returns all the personal data to the controller after the end of the provision of services relating to processing, and deletes existing copies unless Union or Member State law requires storage of the personal data;
(h) makes available to the controller all information necessary to demonstrate compliance with the obligations laid down in this Article and allow for and contribute to audits, including inspections, conducted by the controller or another auditor mandated by the controller.
With regard to point (h) of the first subparagraph, the processor shall immediately inform the controller if, in its opinion, an instruction infringes this Regulation or other Union or Member State data protection provisions.
4. Where a processor engages another processor for carrying out specific processing activities on behalf of the controller, the same data protection obligations as set out in the contract or other legal act between the controller and the processor as referred to in paragraph 3 shall be imposed on that other processor by way of a contract or other legal act under Union or Member State law, in particular providing sufficient guarantees to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures in such a manner that the processing will meet the requirements of this Regulation. Where that other processor fails to fulfil its data protection obligations, the initial processor shall remain fully liable to the controller for the performance of that other processor's obligations.
5. Adherence of a processor to an approved code of conduct as referred to in Article 40 or an approved certification mechanism as referred to in Article 42 may be used as an element by which to demonstrate sufficient guarantees as referred to in paragraphs 1 and 4 of this Article.
6. Without prejudice to an individual contract between the controller and the processor, the contract or the other legal act referred to in paragraphs 3 and 4 of this Article may be based, in whole or in part, on standard contractual clauses referred to in paragraphs 7 and 8 of this Article, including when they are part of a certification granted to the controller or processor pursuant to Articles 42 and 43.
7. The Commission may lay down standard contractual clauses for the matters referred to in paragraph 3 and 4 of this Article and in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 93(2).
8. A supervisory authority may adopt standard contractual clauses for the matters referred to in paragraph 3 and 4 of this Article and in accordance with the consistency mechanism referred to in Article 63.
9. The contract or the other legal act referred to in paragraphs 3 and 4 shall be in writing, including in electronic form.
10. Without prejudice to Articles 82, 83 and 84, if a processor infringes this Regulation by determining the purposes and means of processing, the processor shall be considered to be a controller in respect of that processing.

Principles relating to processing of personal data

1. Personal data shall be:
   (a) processed lawfully, fairly and in a transparent manner in relation to the data subject (‘lawfulness, fairness and
       transparency’);
   (b) collected for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes and not further processed in a manner that is incompatible
       with those purposes; further processing for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research
       purposes or statistical purposes shall, in accordance with Article 89(1), not be considered to be incompatible with
       the initial purposes (‘purpose limitation’);
   (c) adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are processed (‘data
       minimisation’);
   (d) accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date; every reasonable step must be taken to ensure that personal data that
       are inaccurate, having regard to the purposes for which they are processed, are erased or rectified without delay
       (‘accuracy’); 
   (e) kept in a form which permits identification of data subjects for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for
       which the personal data are processed; personal data may be stored for longer periods insofar as the personal data
       will be processed solely for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or
       statistical purposes in accordance with Article 89(1) subject to implementation of the appropriate technical and
       organisational measures required by this Regulation in order to safeguard the rights and freedoms of the data subject
       (‘storage limitation’);
   (f) processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security of the personal data, including protection against
       unauthorised or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction or damage, using appropriate technical
       or organisational measures (‘integrity and confidentiality’).
2. The controller shall be responsible for, and be able to demonstrate compliance with, paragraph 1 (‘accountability’).

Article 6
Lawfulness of processing

1. Processing shall be lawful only if and to the extent that at least one of the following applies:
   (a) the data subject has given consent to the processing of his or her personal data for one or more specific purposes;
   (b) processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party or in order to take steps
       at the request of the data subject prior to entering into a contract;
   (c) processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the controller is subject;
   (d) processing is necessary in order to protect the vital interests of the data subject or of another natural person;
   (e) processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official
       authority vested in the controller;
   (f) processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party,
       except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject
       which require protection of personal data, in particular where the data subject is a child.
   Point (f) of the first subparagraph shall not apply to processing carried out by public authorities in the performance of
   their tasks.
2. Member States may maintain or introduce more specific provisions to adapt the application of the rules of this
   Regulation with regard to processing for compliance with points (c) and (e) of paragraph 1 by determining more
   precisely specific requirements for the processing and other measures to ensure lawful and fair processing including for
   other specific processing situations as provided for in Chapter IX.
3. The basis for the processing referred to in point (c) and (e) of paragraph 1 shall be laid down by:
   (a) Union law; or
   (b) Member State law to which the controller is subject.
   The purpose of the processing shall be determined in that legal basis or, as regards the processing referred to in point (e)
   of paragraph 1, shall be necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of
   official authority vested in the controller. That legal basis may contain specific provisions to adapt the application of
   rules of this Regulation, inter alia: the general conditions governing the lawfulness of processing by the controller; the
   types of data which are subject to the processing; the data subjects concerned; the entities to, and the purposes for
   which, the personal data may be disclosed; the purpose limitation; storage periods; and processing operations and
   processing procedures, including measures to ensure lawful and fair processing such as those for other specific
   processing situations as provided for in Chapter IX. The Union or the Member State law shall meet an objective of
   public interest and be proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued.
4. Where the processing for a purpose other than that for which the personal data have been collected is not based
   on the data subject's consent or on a Union or Member State law which constitutes a necessary and proportionate
   measure in a democratic society to safeguard the objectives referred to in Article 23(1), the controller shall, in order to
   ascertain whether processing for another purpose is compatible with the purpose for which the personal data are
   initially collected, take into account, inter alia:
   (a) any link between the purposes for which the personal data have been collected and the purposes of the intended
       further processing;
   (b) the context in which the personal data have been collected, in particular regarding the relationship between data
       subjects and the controller;
   (c) the nature of the personal data, in particular whether special categories of personal data are processed, pursuant to
       Article 9, or whether personal data related to criminal convictions and offences are processed, pursuant to Article
       10;
   (d) the possible consequences of the intended further processing for data subjects;
   (e) the existence of appropriate safeguards, which may include encryption or pseudonymisation.

"
Article 7
Conditions for consent

1. Where processing is based on consent, the controller shall be able to demonstrate that the data subject has
   consented to processing of his or her personal data.
2. If the data subject's consent is given in the context of a written declaration which also concerns other matters, the
   request for consent shall be presented in a manner which is clearly distinguishable from the other matters, in an
   intelligible and easily accessible form, using clear and plain language. Any part of such a declaration which constitutes
   an infringement of this Regulation shall not be binding.
3. The data subject shall have the right to withdraw his or her consent at any time. The withdrawal of consent shall
   not affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal. Prior to giving consent, the data subject
   shall be informed thereof. It shall be as easy to withdraw as to give consent.
4. When assessing whether consent is freely given, utmost account shall be taken of whether, inter alia, the
   performance of a contract, including the provision of a service, is conditional on consent to the processing of personal
   data that is not necessary for the performance of that contract.
",7,Conditions for consent,2,Principles,204,Can a data subject withdraw their consent for processing their personal data?,"Yes, the data subject shall have the right to withdraw his or her consent at any time. The withdrawal of consent shall not affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal.",12,34

Article 8
Conditions applicable to child's consent in relation to information society services

1. Where point (a) of Article 6(1) applies, in relation to the offer of information society services directly to a child,
   the processing of the personal data of a child shall be lawful where the child is at least 16 years old. Where the child is
   below the age of 16 years, such processing shall be lawful only if and to the extent that consent is given or authorised
   by the holder of parental responsibility over the child.
   Member States may provide by law for a lower age for those purposes provided that such lower age is not below 13
   years.
2. The controller shall make reasonable efforts to verify in such cases that consent is given or authorised by the
   holder of parental responsibility over the child, taking into consideration available technology.
3. Paragraph 1 shall not affect the general contract law of Member States such as the rules on the validity, formation
   or effect of a contract in relation to a child. 
",8,Conditions applicable to child's consent in relation to information society services,2,Principles,177,What is the exception to the age limit for processing personal data of a child in relation to information society services?,Member States may provide by law for a lower age for those purposes provided that such lower age is not below 13 years.,21,23

       purposes, except where Union or Member State law provide that the prohibition referred to in paragraph 1 may not
       be lifted by the data subject;

       which the personal data are processed; personal data may be stored for longer periods insofar as the personal data
       will be processed solely for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or
       statistical purposes in accordance with Article 89(1) subject to implementation of the appropriate technical and
       organisational measures required by this Regulation in order to safeguard the rights and freedoms of the data subject

Article 5
Principles relating to processing of personal data

1. Personal data shall be:
   (a) processed lawfully, fairly and in a transparent manner in relation to the data subject (‘lawfulness, fairness and
       transparency’);
   (b) collected for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes and not further processed in a manner that is incompatible
       with those purposes; further processing for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research
       purposes or statistical purposes shall, in accordance with Article 89(1), not be considered to be incompatible with
       the initial purposes (‘purpose limitation’);
   (c) adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are processed (‘data
       minimisation’);
   (d) accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date; every reasonable step must be taken to ensure that personal data that
       are inaccurate, having regard to the purposes for which they are processed, are erased or rectified without delay
       (‘accuracy’); 
   (e) kept in a form which permits identification of data subjects for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for
       which the personal data are processed; personal data may be stored for longer periods insofar as the personal data
       will be processed solely for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or
       statistical purposes in accordance with Article 89(1) subject to implementation of the appropriate technical and
       organisational measures required by this Regulation in order to safeguard the rights and freedoms of the data subject
       (‘storage limitation’);
   (f) processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security of the personal data, including protection against
       unauthorised or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction or damage, using appropriate technical
       or organisational measures (‘integrity and confidentiality’).
2. The controller shall be responsible for, and be able to demonstrate compliance with, paragraph 1 (‘accountability’).

Article 6
Lawfulness of processing

1. Processing shall be lawful only if and to the extent that at least one of the following applies:
   (a) the data subject has given consent to the processing of his or her personal data for one or more specific purposes;
   (b) processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party or in order to take steps
       at the request of the data subject prior to entering into a contract;
   (c) processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the controller is subject;
   (d) processing is necessary in order to protect the vital interests of the data subject or of another natural person;
   (e) processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official
       authority vested in the controller;
   (f) processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party,
       except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject
       which require protection of personal data, in particular where the data subject is a child.
   Point (f) of the first subparagraph shall not apply to processing carried out by public authorities in the performance of
   their tasks.
2. Member States may maintain or introduce more specific provisions to adapt the application of the rules of this
   Regulation with regard to processing for compliance with points (c) and (e) of paragraph 1 by determining more
   precisely specific requirements for the processing and other measures to ensure lawful and fair processing including for
   other specific processing situations as provided for in Chapter IX.
3. The basis for the processing referred to in point (c) and (e) of paragraph 1 shall be laid down by:
   (a) Union law; or
   (b) Member State law to which the controller is subject.
   The purpose of the processing shall be determined in that legal basis or, as regards the processing referred to in point (e)
   of paragraph 1, shall be necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of
   official authority vested in the controller. That legal basis may contain specific provisions to adapt the application of
   rules of this Regulation, inter alia: the general conditions governing the lawfulness of processing by the controller; the
   types of data which are subject to the processing; the data subjects concerned; the entities to, and the purposes for
   which, the personal data may be disclosed; the purpose limitation; storage periods; and processing operations and
   processing procedures, including measures to ensure lawful and fair processing such as those for other specific
   processing situations as provided for in Chapter IX. The Union or the Member State law shall meet an objective of
   public interest and be proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued.
4. Where the processing for a purpose other than that for which the personal data have been collected is not based
   on the data subject's consent or on a Union or Member State law which constitutes a necessary and proportionate
   measure in a democratic society to safeguard the objectives referred to in Article 23(1), the controller shall, in order to
   ascertain whether processing for another purpose is compatible with the purpose for which the personal data are
   initially collected, take into account, inter alia:
   (a) any link between the purposes for which the personal data have been collected and the purposes of the intended
       further processing;
   (b) the context in which the personal data have been collected, in particular regarding the relationship between data
       subjects and the controller;
   (c) the nature of the personal data, in particular whether special categories of personal data are processed, pursuant to
       Article 9, or whether personal data related to criminal convictions and offences are processed, pursuant to Article
       10;
   (d) the possible consequences of the intended further processing for data subjects;
   (e) the existence of appropriate safeguards, which may include encryption or pseudonymisation.

1. Where processing is based on consent, the controller shall be able to demonstrate that the data subject has
   consented to processing of his or her personal data.
2. If the data subject's consent is given in the context of a written declaration which also concerns other matters, the
   request for consent shall be presented in a manner which is clearly distinguishable from the other matters, in an
   intelligible and easily accessible form, using clear and plain language. Any part of such a declaration which constitutes
   an infringement of this Regulation shall not be binding.
3. The data subject shall have the right to withdraw his or her consent at any time. The withdrawal of consent shall
   not affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal. Prior to giving consent, the data subject
   shall be informed thereof. It shall be as easy to withdraw as to give consent.
4. When assessing whether consent is freely given, utmost account shall be taken of whether, inter alia, the
   performance of a contract, including the provision of a service, is conditional on consent to the processing of personal
   data that is not necessary for the performance of that contract.

Article 5
Principles relating to processing of personal data

1. Personal data shall be:
   (a) processed lawfully, fairly and in a transparent manner in relation to the data subject (‘lawfulness, fairness and
       transparency’);
   (b) collected for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes and not further processed in a manner that is incompatible
       with those purposes; further processing for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research
       purposes or statistical purposes shall, in accordance with Article 89(1), not be considered to be incompatible with
       the initial purposes (‘purpose limitation’);
   (c) adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are processed (‘data
       minimisation’);
   (d) accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date; every reasonable step must be taken to ensure that personal data that
       are inaccurate, having regard to the purposes for which they are processed, are erased or rectified without delay
       (‘accuracy’); 
   (e) kept in a form which permits identification of data subjects for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for
       which the personal data are processed; personal data may be stored for longer periods insofar as the personal data
       will be processed solely for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or
       statistical purposes in accordance with Article 89(1) subject to implementation of the appropriate technical and
       organisational measures required by this Regulation in order to safeguard the rights and freedoms of the data subject
       (‘storage limitation’);
   (f) processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security of the personal data, including protection against
       unauthorised or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction or damage, using appropriate technical
       or organisational measures (‘integrity and confidentiality’).
2. The controller shall be responsible for, and be able to demonstrate compliance with, paragraph 1 (‘accountability’).

Article 6
Lawfulness of processing

1. Processing shall be lawful only if and to the extent that at least one of the following applies:
   (a) the data subject has given consent to the processing of his or her personal data for one or more specific purposes;
   (b) processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party or in order to take steps
       at the request of the data subject prior to entering into a contract;
   (c) processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the controller is subject;
   (d) processing is necessary in order to protect the vital interests of the data subject or of another natural person;
   (e) processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official
       authority vested in the controller;
   (f) processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party,
       except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject
       which require protection of personal data, in particular where the data subject is a child.
   Point (f) of the first subparagraph shall not apply to processing carried out by public authorities in the performance of
   their tasks.
2. Member States may maintain or introduce more specific provisions to adapt the application of the rules of this
   Regulation with regard to processing for compliance with points (c) and (e) of paragraph 1 by determining more
   precisely specific requirements for the processing and other measures to ensure lawful and fair processing including for
   other specific processing situations as provided for in Chapter IX.
3. The basis for the processing referred to in point (c) and (e) of paragraph 1 shall be laid down by:
   (a) Union law; or
   (b) Member State law to which the controller is subject.
   The purpose of the processing shall be determined in that legal basis or, as regards the processing referred to in point (e)
   of paragraph 1, shall be necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of
   official authority vested in the controller. That legal basis may contain specific provisions to adapt the application of
   rules of this Regulation, inter alia: the general conditions governing the lawfulness of processing by the controller; the
   types of data which are subject to the processing; the data subjects concerned; the entities to, and the purposes for
   which, the personal data may be disclosed; the purpose limitation; storage periods; and processing operations and
   processing procedures, including measures to ensure lawful and fair processing such as those for other specific
   processing situations as provided for in Chapter IX. The Union or the Member State law shall meet an objective of
   public interest and be proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued.
4. Where the processing for a purpose other than that for which the personal data have been collected is not based
   on the data subject's consent or on a Union or Member State law which constitutes a necessary and proportionate
   measure in a democratic society to safeguard the objectives referred to in Article 23(1), the controller shall, in order to
   ascertain whether processing for another purpose is compatible with the purpose for which the personal data are
   initially collected, take into account, inter alia:
   (a) any link between the purposes for which the personal data have been collected and the purposes of the intended
       further processing;
   (b) the context in which the personal data have been collected, in particular regarding the relationship between data
       subjects and the controller;
   (c) the nature of the personal data, in particular whether special categories of personal data are processed, pursuant to
       Article 9, or whether personal data related to criminal convictions and offences are processed, pursuant to Article
       10;
   (d) the possible consequences of the intended further processing for data subjects;
   (e) the existence of appropriate safeguards, which may include encryption or pseudonymisation.

Article 7
Conditions for consent

1. Where processing is based on consent, the controller shall be able to demonstrate that the data subject has
   consented to processing of his or her personal data.
2. If the data subject's consent is given in the context of a written declaration which also concerns other matters, the
   request for consent shall be presented in a manner which is clearly distinguishable from the other matters, in an
   intelligible and easily accessible form, using clear and plain language. Any part of such a declaration which constitutes
   an infringement of this Regulation shall not be binding.
3. The data subject shall have the right to withdraw his or her consent at any time. The withdrawal of consent shall
   not affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal. Prior to giving consent, the data subject
   shall be informed thereof. It shall be as easy to withdraw as to give consent.
4. When assessing whether consent is freely given, utmost account shall be taken of whether, inter alia, the
   performance of a contract, including the provision of a service, is conditional on consent to the processing of personal
   data that is not necessary for the performance of that contract.

   below the age of 16 years, such processing shall be lawful only if and to the extent that consent is given or authorised
   by the holder of parental responsibility over the child.
   Member States may provide by law for a lower age for those purposes provided that such lower age is not below 13
   years.

Article 5
Principles relating to processing of personal data

1. Personal data shall be:
   (a) processed lawfully, fairly and in a transparent manner in relation to the data subject (‘lawfulness, fairness and
       transparency’);
   (b) collected for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes and not further processed in a manner that is incompatible
       with those purposes; further processing for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research
       purposes or statistical purposes shall, in accordance with Article 89(1), not be considered to be incompatible with
       the initial purposes (‘purpose limitation’);
   (c) adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are processed (‘data
       minimisation’);
   (d) accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date; every reasonable step must be taken to ensure that personal data that
       are inaccurate, having regard to the purposes for which they are processed, are erased or rectified without delay
       (‘accuracy’); 
   (e) kept in a form which permits identification of data subjects for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for
       which the personal data are processed; personal data may be stored for longer periods insofar as the personal data
       will be processed solely for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or
       statistical purposes in accordance with Article 89(1) subject to implementation of the appropriate technical and
       organisational measures required by this Regulation in order to safeguard the rights and freedoms of the data subject
       (‘storage limitation’);
   (f) processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security of the personal data, including protection against
       unauthorised or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction or damage, using appropriate technical
       or organisational measures (‘integrity and confidentiality’).
2. The controller shall be responsible for, and be able to demonstrate compliance with, paragraph 1 (‘accountability’).

Article 6
Lawfulness of processing

1. Processing shall be lawful only if and to the extent that at least one of the following applies:
   (a) the data subject has given consent to the processing of his or her personal data for one or more specific purposes;
   (b) processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party or in order to take steps
       at the request of the data subject prior to entering into a contract;
   (c) processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the controller is subject;
   (d) processing is necessary in order to protect the vital interests of the data subject or of another natural person;
   (e) processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official
       authority vested in the controller;
   (f) processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party,
       except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject
       which require protection of personal data, in particular where the data subject is a child.
   Point (f) of the first subparagraph shall not apply to processing carried out by public authorities in the performance of
   their tasks.
2. Member States may maintain or introduce more specific provisions to adapt the application of the rules of this
   Regulation with regard to processing for compliance with points (c) and (e) of paragraph 1 by determining more
   precisely specific requirements for the processing and other measures to ensure lawful and fair processing including for
   other specific processing situations as provided for in Chapter IX.
3. The basis for the processing referred to in point (c) and (e) of paragraph 1 shall be laid down by:
   (a) Union law; or
   (b) Member State law to which the controller is subject.
   The purpose of the processing shall be determined in that legal basis or, as regards the processing referred to in point (e)
   of paragraph 1, shall be necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of
   official authority vested in the controller. That legal basis may contain specific provisions to adapt the application of
   rules of this Regulation, inter alia: the general conditions governing the lawfulness of processing by the controller; the
   types of data which are subject to the processing; the data subjects concerned; the entities to, and the purposes for
   which, the personal data may be disclosed; the purpose limitation; storage periods; and processing operations and
   processing procedures, including measures to ensure lawful and fair processing such as those for other specific
   processing situations as provided for in Chapter IX. The Union or the Member State law shall meet an objective of
   public interest and be proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued.
4. Where the processing for a purpose other than that for which the personal data have been collected is not based
   on the data subject's consent or on a Union or Member State law which constitutes a necessary and proportionate
   measure in a democratic society to safeguard the objectives referred to in Article 23(1), the controller shall, in order to
   ascertain whether processing for another purpose is compatible with the purpose for which the personal data are
   initially collected, take into account, inter alia:
   (a) any link between the purposes for which the personal data have been collected and the purposes of the intended
       further processing;
   (b) the context in which the personal data have been collected, in particular regarding the relationship between data
       subjects and the controller;
   (c) the nature of the personal data, in particular whether special categories of personal data are processed, pursuant to
       Article 9, or whether personal data related to criminal convictions and offences are processed, pursuant to Article
       10;
   (d) the possible consequences of the intended further processing for data subjects;
   (e) the existence of appropriate safeguards, which may include encryption or pseudonymisation.

Article 7
Conditions for consent

1. Where processing is based on consent, the controller shall be able to demonstrate that the data subject has
   consented to processing of his or her personal data.
2. If the data subject's consent is given in the context of a written declaration which also concerns other matters, the
   request for consent shall be presented in a manner which is clearly distinguishable from the other matters, in an
   intelligible and easily accessible form, using clear and plain language. Any part of such a declaration which constitutes
   an infringement of this Regulation shall not be binding.
3. The data subject shall have the right to withdraw his or her consent at any time. The withdrawal of consent shall
   not affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal. Prior to giving consent, the data subject
   shall be informed thereof. It shall be as easy to withdraw as to give consent.
4. When assessing whether consent is freely given, utmost account shall be taken of whether, inter alia, the
   performance of a contract, including the provision of a service, is conditional on consent to the processing of personal
   data that is not necessary for the performance of that contract.

Conditions applicable to child's consent in relation to information society services

1. Where point (a) of Article 6(1) applies, in relation to the offer of information society services directly to a child,
   the processing of the personal data of a child shall be lawful where the child is at least 16 years old. Where the child is
   below the age of 16 years, such processing shall be lawful only if and to the extent that consent is given or authorised
   by the holder of parental responsibility over the child.
   Member States may provide by law for a lower age for those purposes provided that such lower age is not below 13
   years.

Article 5
Principles relating to processing of personal data

1. Personal data shall be:
   (a) processed lawfully, fairly and in a transparent manner in relation to the data subject (‘lawfulness, fairness and
       transparency’);
   (b) collected for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes and not further processed in a manner that is incompatible
       with those purposes; further processing for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research
       purposes or statistical purposes shall, in accordance with Article 89(1), not be considered to be incompatible with
       the initial purposes (‘purpose limitation’);
   (c) adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are processed (‘data
       minimisation’);
   (d) accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date; every reasonable step must be taken to ensure that personal data that
       are inaccurate, having regard to the purposes for which they are processed, are erased or rectified without delay
       (‘accuracy’); 
   (e) kept in a form which permits identification of data subjects for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for
       which the personal data are processed; personal data may be stored for longer periods insofar as the personal data
       will be processed solely for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or
       statistical purposes in accordance with Article 89(1) subject to implementation of the appropriate technical and
       organisational measures required by this Regulation in order to safeguard the rights and freedoms of the data subject
       (‘storage limitation’);
   (f) processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security of the personal data, including protection against
       unauthorised or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction or damage, using appropriate technical
       or organisational measures (‘integrity and confidentiality’).
2. The controller shall be responsible for, and be able to demonstrate compliance with, paragraph 1 (‘accountability’).

Article 6
Lawfulness of processing

1. Processing shall be lawful only if and to the extent that at least one of the following applies:
   (a) the data subject has given consent to the processing of his or her personal data for one or more specific purposes;
   (b) processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party or in order to take steps
       at the request of the data subject prior to entering into a contract;
   (c) processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the controller is subject;
   (d) processing is necessary in order to protect the vital interests of the data subject or of another natural person;
   (e) processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official
       authority vested in the controller;
   (f) processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party,
       except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject
       which require protection of personal data, in particular where the data subject is a child.
   Point (f) of the first subparagraph shall not apply to processing carried out by public authorities in the performance of
   their tasks.
2. Member States may maintain or introduce more specific provisions to adapt the application of the rules of this
   Regulation with regard to processing for compliance with points (c) and (e) of paragraph 1 by determining more
   precisely specific requirements for the processing and other measures to ensure lawful and fair processing including for
   other specific processing situations as provided for in Chapter IX.
3. The basis for the processing referred to in point (c) and (e) of paragraph 1 shall be laid down by:
   (a) Union law; or
   (b) Member State law to which the controller is subject.
   The purpose of the processing shall be determined in that legal basis or, as regards the processing referred to in point (e)
   of paragraph 1, shall be necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of
   official authority vested in the controller. That legal basis may contain specific provisions to adapt the application of
   rules of this Regulation, inter alia: the general conditions governing the lawfulness of processing by the controller; the
   types of data which are subject to the processing; the data subjects concerned; the entities to, and the purposes for
   which, the personal data may be disclosed; the purpose limitation; storage periods; and processing operations and
   processing procedures, including measures to ensure lawful and fair processing such as those for other specific
   processing situations as provided for in Chapter IX. The Union or the Member State law shall meet an objective of
   public interest and be proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued.
4. Where the processing for a purpose other than that for which the personal data have been collected is not based
   on the data subject's consent or on a Union or Member State law which constitutes a necessary and proportionate
   measure in a democratic society to safeguard the objectives referred to in Article 23(1), the controller shall, in order to
   ascertain whether processing for another purpose is compatible with the purpose for which the personal data are
   initially collected, take into account, inter alia:
   (a) any link between the purposes for which the personal data have been collected and the purposes of the intended
       further processing;
   (b) the context in which the personal data have been collected, in particular regarding the relationship between data
       subjects and the controller;
   (c) the nature of the personal data, in particular whether special categories of personal data are processed, pursuant to
       Article 9, or whether personal data related to criminal convictions and offences are processed, pursuant to Article
       10;
   (d) the possible consequences of the intended further processing for data subjects;
   (e) the existence of appropriate safeguards, which may include encryption or pseudonymisation.

Article 7
Conditions for consent

1. Where processing is based on consent, the controller shall be able to demonstrate that the data subject has
   consented to processing of his or her personal data.
2. If the data subject's consent is given in the context of a written declaration which also concerns other matters, the
   request for consent shall be presented in a manner which is clearly distinguishable from the other matters, in an
   intelligible and easily accessible form, using clear and plain language. Any part of such a declaration which constitutes
   an infringement of this Regulation shall not be binding.
3. The data subject shall have the right to withdraw his or her consent at any time. The withdrawal of consent shall
   not affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal. Prior to giving consent, the data subject
   shall be informed thereof. It shall be as easy to withdraw as to give consent.
4. When assessing whether consent is freely given, utmost account shall be taken of whether, inter alia, the
   performance of a contract, including the provision of a service, is conditional on consent to the processing of personal
   data that is not necessary for the performance of that contract.

Conditions applicable to child's consent in relation to information society services

1. Where point (a) of Article 6(1) applies, in relation to the offer of information society services directly to a child,
   the processing of the personal data of a child shall be lawful where the child is at least 16 years old. Where the child is
   below the age of 16 years, such processing shall be lawful only if and to the extent that consent is given or authorised
   by the holder of parental responsibility over the child.
   Member States may provide by law for a lower age for those purposes provided that such lower age is not below 13
   years.

   when those data are processed by or under the responsibility of a professional subject to the obligation of professional
   secrecy under Union or Member State law or rules established by national competent bodies or by another person also

(b) the controller has taken subsequent measures which ensure that the high risk to the rights and freedoms of data subjects referred to in paragraph 1 is no longer likely to materialise;
(c) it would involve disproportionate effort. In such a case, there shall instead be a public communication or similar measure whereby the data subjects are informed in an equally effective manner.
4. If the controller has not already communicated the personal data breach to the data subject, the supervisory authority, having considered the likelihood of the personal data breach resulting in a high risk, may require it to do so or may decide that any of the conditions referred to in paragraph 3 are met.

Article 35
Data protection impact assessment
1. Where a type of processing in particular using new technologies, and taking into account the nature, scope, context and purposes of the processing, is likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, the controller shall, prior to the processing, carry out an assessment of the impact of the envisaged processing operations on the protection of personal data. A single assessment may address a set of similar processing operations that present similar high risks.
2. The controller shall seek the advice of the data protection officer, where designated, when carrying out a data protection impact assessment.
3. A data protection impact assessment referred to in paragraph 1 shall in particular be required in the case of:
(a) a systematic and extensive evaluation of personal aspects relating to natural persons which is based on automated processing, including profiling, and on which decisions are based that produce legal effects concerning the natural person or similarly significantly affect the natural person;
(b) processing on a large scale of special categories of data referred to in Article 9(1), or of personal data relating to criminal convictions and offences referred to in Article 10; or
(c) a systematic monitoring of a publicly accessible area on a large scale.
4. The supervisory authority shall establish and make public a list of the kind of processing operations which are subject to the requirement for a data protection impact assessment pursuant to paragraph 1. The supervisory authority shall communicate those lists to the Board referred to in Article 68.
5. The supervisory authority may also establish and make public a list of the kind of processing operations for which no data protection impact assessment is required. The supervisory authority shall communicate those lists to the Board.
6. Prior to the adoption of the lists referred to in paragraphs 4 and 5, the competent supervisory authority shall apply the consistency mechanism referred to in Article 63 where such lists involve processing activities which are related to the offering of goods or services to data subjects or to the monitoring of their behaviour in several Member States, or may substantially affect the free movement of personal data within the Union.
7. The assessment shall contain at least:
(a) a systematic description of the envisaged processing operations and the purposes of the processing, including, where applicable, the legitimate interest pursued by the controller;
(b) an assessment of the necessity and proportionality of the processing operations in relation to the purposes;
(c) an assessment of the risks to the rights and freedoms of data subjects referred to in paragraph 1; and
(d) the measures envisaged to address the risks, including safeguards, security measures and mechanisms to ensure the protection of personal data and to demonstrate compliance with this Regulation taking into account the rights and legitimate interests of data subjects and other persons concerned.
8. Compliance with approved codes of conduct referred to in Article 40 by the relevant controllers or processors shall be taken into due account in assessing the impact of the processing operations performed by such controllers or processors, in particular for the purposes of a data protection impact assessment.
9. Where appropriate, the controller shall seek the views of data subjects or their representatives on the intended processing, without prejudice to the protection of commercial or public interests or the security of processing operations.
10. Where processing pursuant to point (c) or (e) of Article 6(1) has a legal basis in Union law or in the law of the Member State to which the controller is subject, that law regulates the specific processing operation or set of operations in question, and a data protection impact assessment has already been carried out as part of a general impact assessment in the context of the adoption of that legal basis, paragraphs 1 to 7 shall not apply unless Member States deem it to be necessary to carry out such an assessment prior to processing activities.
11. Where necessary, the controller shall carry out a review to assess if processing is performed in accordance with the data protection impact assessment at least when there is a change of the risk represented by processing operations.

Article 36
Prior consultation
1. The controller shall consult the supervisory authority prior to processing where a data protection impact assessment under Article 35 indicates that the processing would result in a high risk in the absence of measures taken by the controller to mitigate the risk.
2. Where the supervisory authority is of the opinion that the intended processing referred to in paragraph 1 would infringe this Regulation, in particular where the controller has insufficiently identified or mitigated the risk, the supervisory authority shall, within period of up to eight weeks of receipt of the request for consultation, provide written advice to the controller and, where applicable to the processor, and may use any of its powers referred to in Article 58. That period may be extended by six weeks, taking into account the complexity of the intended processing. The supervisory authority shall inform the controller and, where applicable, the processor, of any such extension within one month of receipt of the request for consultation together with the reasons for the delay. Those periods may be suspended until the supervisory authority has obtained information it has requested for the purposes of the consultation.
3. When consulting the supervisory authority pursuant to paragraph 1, the controller shall provide the supervisory authority with:
(a) where applicable, the respective responsibilities of the controller, joint controllers and processors involved in the processing, in particular for processing within a group of undertakings;
(b) the purposes and means of the intended processing;
(c) the measures and safeguards provided to protect the rights and freedoms of data subjects pursuant to this Regulation;
(d) where applicable, the contact details of the data protection officer;
(e) the data protection impact assessment provided for in Article 35; and
(f) any other information requested by the supervisory authority.
4. Member States shall consult the supervisory authority during the preparation of a proposal for a legislative measure to be adopted by a national parliament, or of a regulatory measure based on such a legislative measure, which relates to processing.
5. Notwithstanding paragraph 1, Member State law may require controllers to consult with, and obtain prior author­ isation from, the supervisory authority in relation to processing by a controller for the performance of a task carried out by the controller in the public interest, including processing in relation to social protection and public health.

Article 5
Principles relating to processing of personal data

1. Personal data shall be:
   (a) processed lawfully, fairly and in a transparent manner in relation to the data subject (‘lawfulness, fairness and
       transparency’);
   (b) collected for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes and not further processed in a manner that is incompatible
       with those purposes; further processing for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research
       purposes or statistical purposes shall, in accordance with Article 89(1), not be considered to be incompatible with
       the initial purposes (‘purpose limitation’);
   (c) adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are processed (‘data
       minimisation’);
   (d) accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date; every reasonable step must be taken to ensure that personal data that
       are inaccurate, having regard to the purposes for which they are processed, are erased or rectified without delay
       (‘accuracy’); 
   (e) kept in a form which permits identification of data subjects for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for
       which the personal data are processed; personal data may be stored for longer periods insofar as the personal data
       will be processed solely for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or
       statistical purposes in accordance with Article 89(1) subject to implementation of the appropriate technical and
       organisational measures required by this Regulation in order to safeguard the rights and freedoms of the data subject
       (‘storage limitation’);
   (f) processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security of the personal data, including protection against
       unauthorised or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction or damage, using appropriate technical
       or organisational measures (‘integrity and confidentiality’).
2. The controller shall be responsible for, and be able to demonstrate compliance with, paragraph 1 (‘accountability’).
",5,Principles relating to processing of personal data,2,Principles,295,What is the scope of Article 5 of GDPR?,The scope of Article 5 of GDPR is to apply to the processing of personal data wholly or partly by automated means and to the processing other than by automated means of personal data which form part of a filing system or are intended to form part of a filing system.,9,51

Article 6
Lawfulness of processing

1. Processing shall be lawful only if and to the extent that at least one of the following applies:
   (a) the data subject has given consent to the processing of his or her personal data for one or more specific purposes;
   (b) processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party or in order to take steps
       at the request of the data subject prior to entering into a contract;
   (c) processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the controller is subject;
   (d) processing is necessary in order to protect the vital interests of the data subject or of another natural person;
   (e) processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official
       authority vested in the controller;
   (f) processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party,
       except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject
       which require protection of personal data, in particular where the data subject is a child.
   Point (f) of the first subparagraph shall not apply to processing carried out by public authorities in the performance of
   their tasks.
2. Member States may maintain or introduce more specific provisions to adapt the application of the rules of this
   Regulation with regard to processing for compliance with points (c) and (e) of paragraph 1 by determining more
   precisely specific requirements for the processing and other measures to ensure lawful and fair processing including for
   other specific processing situations as provided for in Chapter IX.
3. The basis for the processing referred to in point (c) and (e) of paragraph 1 shall be laid down by:
   (a) Union law; or
   (b) Member State law to which the controller is subject.
   The purpose of the processing shall be determined in that legal basis or, as regards the processing referred to in point (e)
   of paragraph 1, shall be necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of
   official authority vested in the controller. That legal basis may contain specific provisions to adapt the application of
   rules of this Regulation, inter alia: the general conditions governing the lawfulness of processing by the controller; the
   types of data which are subject to the processing; the data subjects concerned; the entities to, and the purposes for
   which, the personal data may be disclosed; the purpose limitation; storage periods; and processing operations and
   processing procedures, including measures to ensure lawful and fair processing such as those for other specific
   processing situations as provided for in Chapter IX. The Union or the Member State law shall meet an objective of
   public interest and be proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued.
4. Where the processing for a purpose other than that for which the personal data have been collected is not based
   on the data subject's consent or on a Union or Member State law which constitutes a necessary and proportionate
   measure in a democratic society to safeguard the objectives referred to in Article 23(1), the controller shall, in order to
   ascertain whether processing for another purpose is compatible with the purpose for which the personal data are
   initially collected, take into account, inter alia:
   (a) any link between the purposes for which the personal data have been collected and the purposes of the intended
       further processing;
   (b) the context in which the personal data have been collected, in particular regarding the relationship between data
       subjects and the controller;
   (c) the nature of the personal data, in particular whether special categories of personal data are processed, pursuant to
       Article 9, or whether personal data related to criminal convictions and offences are processed, pursuant to Article
       10;
   (d) the possible consequences of the intended further processing for data subjects;
   (e) the existence of appropriate safeguards, which may include encryption or pseudonymisation.
",6,Lawfulness of processing,2,Principles,671,What is the purpose of processing personal data for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller?,The purpose of processing personal data for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller is to ensure that the controller can carry out its tasks or exercise its powers in the public interest.,31,48

Article 7
Conditions for consent

1. Where processing is based on consent, the controller shall be able to demonstrate that the data subject has
   consented to processing of his or her personal data.
2. If the data subject's consent is given in the context of a written declaration which also concerns other matters, the
   request for consent shall be presented in a manner which is clearly distinguishable from the other matters, in an
   intelligible and easily accessible form, using clear and plain language. Any part of such a declaration which constitutes
   an infringement of this Regulation shall not be binding.
3. The data subject shall have the right to withdraw his or her consent at any time. The withdrawal of consent shall
   not affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal. Prior to giving consent, the data subject
   shall be informed thereof. It shall be as easy to withdraw as to give consent.
4. When assessing whether consent is freely given, utmost account shall be taken of whether, inter alia, the
   performance of a contract, including the provision of a service, is conditional on consent to the processing of personal
   data that is not necessary for the performance of that contract.

Conditions applicable to child's consent in relation to information society services

1. Where point (a) of Article 6(1) applies, in relation to the offer of information society services directly to a child,
   the processing of the personal data of a child shall be lawful where the child is at least 16 years old. Where the child is
   below the age of 16 years, such processing shall be lawful only if and to the extent that consent is given or authorised
   by the holder of parental responsibility over the child.
   Member States may provide by law for a lower age for those purposes provided that such lower age is not below 13
   years.

Article 5
Principles relating to processing of personal data

1. Personal data shall be:
   (a) processed lawfully, fairly and in a transparent manner in relation to the data subject (‘lawfulness, fairness and
       transparency’);
   (b) collected for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes and not further processed in a manner that is incompatible
       with those purposes; further processing for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research
       purposes or statistical purposes shall, in accordance with Article 89(1), not be considered to be incompatible with
       the initial purposes (‘purpose limitation’);
   (c) adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are processed (‘data
       minimisation’);
   (d) accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date; every reasonable step must be taken to ensure that personal data that
       are inaccurate, having regard to the purposes for which they are processed, are erased or rectified without delay
       (‘accuracy’); 
   (e) kept in a form which permits identification of data subjects for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for
       which the personal data are processed; personal data may be stored for longer periods insofar as the personal data
       will be processed solely for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or
       statistical purposes in accordance with Article 89(1) subject to implementation of the appropriate technical and
       organisational measures required by this Regulation in order to safeguard the rights and freedoms of the data subject
       (‘storage limitation’);
   (f) processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security of the personal data, including protection against
       unauthorised or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction or damage, using appropriate technical
       or organisational measures (‘integrity and confidentiality’).
2. The controller shall be responsible for, and be able to demonstrate compliance with, paragraph 1 (‘accountability’).

Article 6
Lawfulness of processing

1. Processing shall be lawful only if and to the extent that at least one of the following applies:
   (a) the data subject has given consent to the processing of his or her personal data for one or more specific purposes;
   (b) processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party or in order to take steps
       at the request of the data subject prior to entering into a contract;
   (c) processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the controller is subject;
   (d) processing is necessary in order to protect the vital interests of the data subject or of another natural person;
   (e) processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official
       authority vested in the controller;
   (f) processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party,
       except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject
       which require protection of personal data, in particular where the data subject is a child.
   Point (f) of the first subparagraph shall not apply to processing carried out by public authorities in the performance of
   their tasks.
2. Member States may maintain or introduce more specific provisions to adapt the application of the rules of this
   Regulation with regard to processing for compliance with points (c) and (e) of paragraph 1 by determining more
   precisely specific requirements for the processing and other measures to ensure lawful and fair processing including for
   other specific processing situations as provided for in Chapter IX.
3. The basis for the processing referred to in point (c) and (e) of paragraph 1 shall be laid down by:
   (a) Union law; or
   (b) Member State law to which the controller is subject.
   The purpose of the processing shall be determined in that legal basis or, as regards the processing referred to in point (e)
   of paragraph 1, shall be necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of
   official authority vested in the controller. That legal basis may contain specific provisions to adapt the application of
   rules of this Regulation, inter alia: the general conditions governing the lawfulness of processing by the controller; the
   types of data which are subject to the processing; the data subjects concerned; the entities to, and the purposes for
   which, the personal data may be disclosed; the purpose limitation; storage periods; and processing operations and
   processing procedures, including measures to ensure lawful and fair processing such as those for other specific
   processing situations as provided for in Chapter IX. The Union or the Member State law shall meet an objective of
   public interest and be proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued.
4. Where the processing for a purpose other than that for which the personal data have been collected is not based
   on the data subject's consent or on a Union or Member State law which constitutes a necessary and proportionate
   measure in a democratic society to safeguard the objectives referred to in Article 23(1), the controller shall, in order to
   ascertain whether processing for another purpose is compatible with the purpose for which the personal data are
   initially collected, take into account, inter alia:
   (a) any link between the purposes for which the personal data have been collected and the purposes of the intended
       further processing;
   (b) the context in which the personal data have been collected, in particular regarding the relationship between data
       subjects and the controller;
   (c) the nature of the personal data, in particular whether special categories of personal data are processed, pursuant to
       Article 9, or whether personal data related to criminal convictions and offences are processed, pursuant to Article
       10;
   (d) the possible consequences of the intended further processing for data subjects;
   (e) the existence of appropriate safeguards, which may include encryption or pseudonymisation.

Conditions for consent

1. Where processing is based on consent, the controller shall be able to demonstrate that the data subject has
   consented to processing of his or her personal data.
2. If the data subject's consent is given in the context of a written declaration which also concerns other matters, the
   request for consent shall be presented in a manner which is clearly distinguishable from the other matters, in an
   intelligible and easily accessible form, using clear and plain language. Any part of such a declaration which constitutes
   an infringement of this Regulation shall not be binding.
3. The data subject shall have the right to withdraw his or her consent at any time. The withdrawal of consent shall
   not affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal. Prior to giving consent, the data subject
   shall be informed thereof. It shall be as easy to withdraw as to give consent.
4. When assessing whether consent is freely given, utmost account shall be taken of whether, inter alia, the
   performance of a contract, including the provision of a service, is conditional on consent to the processing of personal
   data that is not necessary for the performance of that contract.
",7,Conditions for consent,2,Principles,204,What is the purpose of the condition for obtaining valid consent?,The purpose of the condition for obtaining valid consent is to ensure that data subjects are fully informed and have given their explicit consent for the processing of their personal data.,11,31

1. Where point (a) of Article 6(1) applies, in relation to the offer of information society services directly to a child,
   the processing of the personal data of a child shall be lawful where the child is at least 16 years old. Where the child is
   below the age of 16 years, such processing shall be lawful only if and to the extent that consent is given or authorised
   by the holder of parental responsibility over the child.
   Member States may provide by law for a lower age for those purposes provided that such lower age is not below 13
   years.
